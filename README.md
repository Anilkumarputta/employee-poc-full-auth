> A complete enterprise-level employee management platform with role-based access control, real-time messaging, and smart approval workflows.

## 🎯 What is This?

Think of this as a complete HR management system that handles everything from employee data to leave requests. It's like having three different apps in one:
- **Directors** get the bird's-eye view of the entire company
- **Managers** focus on their team's performance and approvals  
- **Employees** can manage their profile, request leaves, and stay connected

The best part? Everyone sees a different dashboard based on their role, but the UI looks consistent and professional across all levels!

## 🛠️ Running Locally (Step-by-Step)

### **What You'll Need**
- Node.js 18 or higher ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- PostgreSQL database ([Get free one at Render.com](https://render.com/))
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- 10 minutes of your time ☕

### **Step 1: Get the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/employee-poc-full-auth.git
cd employee-poc-full-auth
```

### **Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Server)**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Go to backend folder
cd backend-node

# Install all the packages (this takes ~2 minutes)
npm install

# Create your environment file
# Copy this and save as .env in backend-node folder:
```

Create a file called `.env` in the `backend-node` folder with this content:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-change-this"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-refresh-secret-key-change-this"
PORT=4000
```

> 💡 **Don't have a database?** Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) → Create Free PostgreSQL → Copy the "External Database URL" → Paste it as DATABASE_URL

```bash
# Set up the database tables
npx prisma db push

# Create test accounts (director, manager, employee)
npx prisma db seed

# Generate database client
npx prisma generate

# Start the server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
npm run dev
```

✅ **You should see:** `🚀 GraphQL Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`

### **Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (Website)**

Open a **NEW terminal** (keep the backend running!) and run:

```bash
# Go to frontend folder (from project root)
cd frontend

# Install packages
npm install

# Start the app (runs on http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev
```

✅ **You should see:** `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

### **Step 4: Open and Login!**

1. Open your browser to **http://localhost:5173**
2. You'll see the login page
3. Use one of these accounts to try different roles:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error when submitting leave request
**Solution:** Log out and log back in. This refreshes your authentication token.

### Backend won't start
**Check:**
1. Is PostgreSQL running?
2. Is your `.env` file in the `backend-node` folder?
3. Is the DATABASE_URL correct?
4. Did you run `npx prisma db push`?

### Frontend won't connect to backend
**Check:**
1. Is the backend running on port 4000?
2. Check `frontend/src/lib/graphqlClient.ts` - should point to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Port already in use
**Solution:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :4000  # Find process using port 4000
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F  # Kill that process

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9
```
